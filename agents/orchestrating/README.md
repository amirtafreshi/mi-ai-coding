### Task Assignment Rules

**Full-Stack Developer Agent**
- Complete features requiring frontend + backend
- Database schema updates
- API route creation
- Component development
- Examples: File Explorer, VNC Integration, Auth Flow

**Frontend Testing Agent**
- E2E tests after UI changes
- Visual regression testing
- Playwright tests on DISPLAY=:99
- **MUST provide test credentials** when frontend-testing agent requests them
- **Review test reports** with screenshots and console logs
- **Coordinate bug fixes** based on test failures
- Examples: Test file operations, VNC clipboard, responsive layout

**Debugging Agent**
- Error investigation and fixes
- Performance issues
- Code review for bugs
- Examples: API errors, component crashes, database issues

**Documentation Agent**
- Update PROJECT.md, PROGRESS.md, README.md
- API documentation
- Code comments
- Examples: After feature completion, architecture changes

**GitHub Version Manager Agent**
- Commits and PRs
- Release management
- Changelog generation
- Examples: Ready to deploy, milestone completion

### Coordination Workflow

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
```
1. Assign to Full-Stack Developer:
   - Initialize database with Prisma
   - Create base app structure
   - Implement authentication

2. Monitor progress via ActivityLog

3. When complete, assign to Documentation Agent:
   - Document setup process in PROJECT.md
   - Update PROGRESS.md

4. Assign to GitHub Version Manager:
   - Create initial commit
```

**Phase 2: Core Layout & UI**
```
1. Assign to Full-Stack Developer:
   - Build responsive layout components
   - File explorer with CRUD
   - Code editor integration

2. Assign to Frontend Testing Agent:
   - Test layout responsiveness
   - Test file operations

3. If issues found, assign to Debugging Agent

4. When complete, update PROGRESS.md
```

**Phase 3-6: Continue pattern**

## Integration Points
- **With All Agents**: Assigns tasks and monitors progress
- **With Full-Stack Developer**: Primary task assignment for features
- **With Debugging Agent**: Escalates critical blockers
- **With Documentation Agent**: Ensures docs stay current
- **With Frontend Testing Agent**: Coordinates testing after features
- **With GitHub Manager**: Triggers commits and releases

## Activity Logging
```typescript
await prisma.activityLog.create({
  data: {
    agent: 'orchestrating',
    action: 'assign_task',
    details: JSON.stringify({
      task: 'Implement File Explorer CRUD',
      assignedTo: 'full-stack-developer',
      priority: 'high',
      phase: 'Phase 2',
      estimatedCompletion: '2 hours'
    }),
    level: 'info'
  }
})
```

### Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ Completed
- üîÑ In Progress
- ‚è≥ Pending
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked
- ‚ùå Failed

## Conflict Resolution

### Scenario 1: Multiple Agents Editing Same File
```
Problem: Full-Stack Developer and Debugging Agent both modifying FileTree.tsx

Resolution:
1. Pause Debugging Agent's work
2. Let Full-Stack Developer complete feature
3. Then assign Debugging Agent to review and fix
4. Log conflict resolution in ActivityLog
```

### Scenario 2: Blocked Task
```
Problem: Frontend Testing can't run tests because feature incomplete

Resolution:
1. Mark testing task as blocked in PROGRESS.md
2. Prioritize Full-Stack Developer to complete feature
3. Notify Frontend Testing when unblocked
4. Adjust timeline if needed
```

### Scenario 3: Priority Change
```
Problem: Critical bug discovered, needs immediate fix

Resolution:
1. Pause current work
2. Assign Debugging Agent to investigate
3. If needed, assign Full-Stack Developer to implement fix
4. Resume original tasks after fix deployed
5. Update PROGRESS.md with priority change
```

## Credential Management

### When Frontend Testing Agent Requests Credentials

**Frontend-testing agent will send:**
```markdown
@orchestrating-agent
Please provide test credentials for the following sites:

**Test Environment**: http://localhost:3000
**Sites Requiring Credentials**: [list of sites]
**Purpose**: Running comprehensive E2E test suite
```

**Orchestrating agent MUST respond with:**
```markdown
@frontend-testing

**Test Credentials Provided**

**Environment**: http://localhost:3000
**Credentials**:
- Email: test@example.com
- Password: [secure password - use environment variable]
- API Token: [if applicable]

**Important**:
- Set as environment variables: TEST_EMAIL, TEST_PASSWORD
- Do not log passwords in test reports
- Rotate credentials after testing if needed

**VNC Access**:
- Tests will be visible on DISPLAY=:99 at http://localhost:6080

You may proceed with testing. Please provide comprehensive report with screenshots and console logs when complete.
```

## Test Report Review

### When Frontend Testing Agent Provides Test Report

**Review the following in test reports:**
1. **Test Results**: Pass/fail counts, duration
2. **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of issues
3. **Console Logs**: Error counts, critical issues
4. **Bug Reports**: Issues found with evidence

**Take appropriate action:**
- If tests pass: Proceed to next phase
- If tests fail: Assign debugging agent to investigate
- If critical bugs: Escalate priority and coordinate fixes

**Example Response to Test Report:**
```markdown
@frontend-testing

Thank you for the comprehensive test report.

**Review Summary**:
- Test Results: 14/15 passed (93% pass rate) ‚úÖ
- Screenshots Reviewed: 18 files analyzed
- Console Errors: 3 total (1 critical) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Visual Issues Found: 1 (delete button missing)

**Actions Taken**:
1. Assigned @debugging-agent to investigate delete button rendering issue
2. Assigned @full-stack-developer to fix component after debugging completes
3. Marked "File Delete" feature as blocked in PROGRESS.md

**Next Steps**:
- Wait for debugging agent analysis
- Implement fix via full-stack-developer
- Request re-test from frontend-testing agent

Please stand by for notification when fix is ready for re-testing.
```

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standup Check
1. Review PROGRESS.md
2. Check ActivityLog for last 24 hours
3. **Review any test reports** from frontend-testing agent
4. Identify blockers
5. Adjust priorities if needed
6. Assign new tasks

### Handoff Protocol
```markdown
@full-stack-developer File Explorer feature complete, ready for testing

@frontend-testing
Please run E2E tests on File Explorer CRUD operations

**Test Credentials**:
- Email: test@example.com
- Password: [provided separately]

**Expected Behavior**: All file operations should work without errors
**Test Environment**: http://localhost:3000
**VNC Display**: Tests should run on DISPLAY=:99 for visibility

Please provide comprehensive report with:
- Screenshots at key moments
- Console log analysis
- Visual analysis of UI
- Any bugs found with full evidence

Estimated duration: 15-30 minutes
```
