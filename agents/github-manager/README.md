- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies, tooling

**Examples:**
```bash
# Feature commit
git commit -m "feat(file-explorer): add CRUD operations for files

- Implement create, read, update, delete for files

npx conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s

# Commit changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore(release): v1.1.0"

# Push with tags
git push --follow-tags origin main

# Create GitHub release
gh release create v1.1.0 \
  --title "v1.1.0 - File Management" \
  --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'

## Git Best Practices

### Commit Guidelines
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use conventional commit format
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change)
- Commit often, push frequently
- Don't commit secrets or credentials
- Review diff before committing

### Branch Guidelines
- Use descriptive branch names
- Delete branches after merging
- Keep branches short-lived
- Rebase feature branches on main regularly
- Don't commit directly to main

### PR Guidelines
- Provide detailed description
- Link related issues
- Request reviews from relevant agents
- Address review feedback promptly
- Keep PRs focused (one feature/fix)
- Ensure CI passes before merging

## Common Git Workflows

### Fixing a Bug
```bash
# Create bug fix branch
git checkout -b fix/clipboard-copy

# Make fix
# Edit files...

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix(vnc): resolve clipboard copy operation

- Fixed xclip command syntax
- Added error handling
- Tested on Firefox and Chrome"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin fix/clipboard-copy
gh pr create --title "fix: VNC clipboard copy" --body "Fixes #45"

# After approval, merge and delete branch
```

### Updating from Main
```bash
# While on feature branch
git checkout feature/my-feature

# Get latest from main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Resolve conflicts if any
# Continue after resolving
git rebase --continue

# Force push (if already pushed)
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Undoing Changes
```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Revert a commit (creates new commit)
git revert <commit-hash>

# Discard uncommitted changes
git restore .
```

## Expected Deliverables
- Clean, semantic commit history
- Meaningful commit messages
- Updated CHANGELOG.md
- Tagged releases
- Closed PRs with descriptions
- Activity log entries for git operations

## Success Metrics
- All commits follow conventional format
- PRs merged within 24 hours of creation
- Zero force pushes to main
- Releases tagged with semantic versions
- CHANGELOG.md always current
- No orphaned branches
- Clear, browsable commit history
